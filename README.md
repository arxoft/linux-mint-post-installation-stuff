# Linux Mint - Post Installation Stuff

Installation of several needed packages and system tweaks and configurations I need for my shiny new Linux Mint get rocking. Supported Linux Mint version is always the latest stable one. For older versions of Linux Mint, head to release tags.

## Usage

It is so simple that it is hard to explain. Right after installation of supported Linux Mint version, I run `./install` and follow along.

## What it does to my system?

Nothing harmful, just installs and configures following:

- LAMP Stack
- Python, Pip
- NodeJS, NPM, Yarn
- Docker
- AWS CLI
- Git
- Gimp
- My favorite fonts
- Others
  - vlc
  - dropbox 
  - virtualbox
  - kolourpaint
  - and much more...
